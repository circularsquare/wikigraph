# wikigraph
the goal: 
  make a graph embedding of wikipedia's hyperlink network, with the set of nodes restricted to those with geographical locations, to see if there's any relationship between their location and their relative locations in the embedding.
  uses the mediawiki api and the stanford network analysis platform (snap) node2vec.
